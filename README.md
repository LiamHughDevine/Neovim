# Reinstalling

If I've accidentally fucked up and need to redo everything, instructions:

- Install git

- Install linuxbrew (read the message carefully as will need to do some other
stuff for it

- brew install neovim (to get latest version)

- Install packer

- sudo apt-get install build-essential

- go into lua/LHD and do :so :PackerSync
